## Introduction

This repository is a collection of solutions to various common programming problems written in C#. Each problem is solved with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and best coding practices. Whether you are preparing for interviews, practicing your coding skills, or learning C#, this repository aims to be a valuable resource.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized in folders and every folder cotains minimum two files one is problem_name.md(problem description) and problem_name.cs(problem solution code in c#) and there can be one more readme file to describe the solution.

- Each problem is contained in its own directory.
- Each directory contains the C# solution file (`ProblemX.cs`), the test cases (`ProblemXTest.cs`), and a README file with problem descriptions and explanations (`README.md`).

## Installation

To run the solutions locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    https://github.com/parmindersinghswe/problems.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the repository:**

    ```sh
    cd Problems
    ```

3. **Open the solution in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio):**

    ```sh
    start Problems.sln
    ```

## Usage

Each problem directory contains a C# file with the solution and a corresponding test file. To run the solutions and tests:

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
2. Build the solution to restore the necessary packages.
3. Run the tests to verify the solutions.

Alternatively, you can use the .NET CLI to run the tests:

```sh
dotnet test
