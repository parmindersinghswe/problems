# Square Root of x

## Problem Description

Given a non-negative integer `x`, the task is to return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well. You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator (e.g., `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python).

## Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `x = 4`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `x = 8`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The square root of 8 is approximately 2.82842, and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

## Constraints
- \(0 \leq x \leq 2^{31} - 1\)
