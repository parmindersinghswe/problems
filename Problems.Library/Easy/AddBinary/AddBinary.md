# Binary String Addition

## Problem Description

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, the task is to return their sum as a binary string.

## Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `a = "11"`, `b = "1"`
- **Output:** `"100"`

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `a = "1010"`, `b = "1011"`
- **Output:** `"10101"`

## Constraints
- The length of `a` and `b` is between `1` and `10^4`.
- `a` and `b` consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
