## Solution
To optimize the solution to better than O(n^2) time complexity, a dictionary (hashmap) is utilized. This approach leverages the ability of hashmaps to check if a particular element exists in constant time. The algorithm iterates through the array, computes the complement needed to reach the target for each element, and checks if this complement exists in the hashmap. If it does, the indices of the current element and the complement are returned. If not, the element and its index are added to the hashmap. This optimization allows the solution to run in O(n) time complexity, significantly faster than the naive approach.
